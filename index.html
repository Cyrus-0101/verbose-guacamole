        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Striving to solve problems is my passion, I enjoy creating solutions that impact the greater community, with the ability to leverage physical sciences to the real world.
          As a student, I have valued research and the need to see what was done before so as to avoid future mistakes, incorporating both future and past, to build valid solutions.
          On my free time, I read (and write) journals, tech articles, books and attend as many conferences as possible to add to my pool of knowledge in my area of expertise.
